To do:
- solve for bs coordiantes
- add noise only to test data and see the performance check
- try one bit information.
---------------------------------------
- add noise levels to inputs to both train and test with var  1/20, 1/200, 1/2000 of expected mod h square. Extension
  to output in future.
- generate dataset for one subcarrier , 64(128) antenna, train with network and save the nmse.
----------------------------------------
-  train autoencoder for downlink-downlink, uplink-downlink, uplink+loc-downlink 
- use detach in model.forward

- Completed the channel predictions experiments
- Completed the autoencoder experiments for 128,64,32 antennas. This was done for all five schemes mentioned in the report.
