To do:
- solve for bs coordiantes
- add noise only to test data and see the performance check
- try one bit information.
---------------------------------------
- add noise levels to inputs to both train and test with var  1/20, 1/200, 1/2000 of expected mod h square. Extension
  to output in future.
- generate dataset for one subcarrier , 64(128) antenna, train with network and save the nmse.
----------------------------------------
-  train autoencoder for downlink-downlink, uplink-downlink, uplink+loc-downlink 
- use detach in model.forward

July 15 2020
- Completed the channel predictions experiments
- Completed the autoencoder experiments for 128,64,32 antennas. This was done for all five schemes mentioned in the report.

Rerun Experiments
- 64 ofdm 5 paths for all possible feature combinations and noise levels completed (start : 26/07/2020 end : 01/08/2020)
- 128 antenna 5 paths for 3 feature combinations completed (start : 03/08/2020 end : 06/08/2020)
- 128 antenna(one hot encoding) autoencoder experiments completed (start : 07/08/2020 end : 10/08/2020)

Ongoing Experiments
- Check the performances when message is one hot encoded or sequenced (start : end : )
